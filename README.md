## My process 🌱

### Built with 🚀

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first worflow

### What I learned 📚

My main goal when taking on this challenge was to learn how to use Git and GitHub. I learned how to work with the Linux command line to initiate a repository, using remote repositories, commiting and pushing changes. For this, [Git and Github tutorial - Version Control for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/) by Ihechikara Vincent Abba was extremely helpful. As for the challenge itself, I also learned how to vertically and horizontally align a `<div>` with the `position` and `transform` properties.

### Continued development 💡

 In future projects, I'd like to get more comfortable with using Git on the command line and commit more often. On top of that, I'm keen on playing more with the `box-shadow` property to see what I can come up with.
