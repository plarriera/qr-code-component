## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first worflow

### What I learned

My main goal when taking on this challenge was to learn how to use Git and GitHub. I learned how to work with the Linux command line to initiate a repository, using remote repositories, commiting and pushing changes. For this, [Git and Github tutorial - Version Control for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/) by Ihechikara Vincent Abba was extremely helpful. As for the challenge itself, I also learned how to vertically and horizontally align a `<div>` with the `position` and `transform` properties.

### Continued development

 In future projects, I'd like to get more comfortable with using Git on the command line and commit more often. On top of that, I'm keen on playing more with the `box-shadow` property to see what I can come up with.
